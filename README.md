## Highlight

- `panel_flutter.m` (primary portfolio candidate in this repo)

## Contents

- Homework scripts (`hw*.m`)
- Midterm/practice scripts (`midterm.m`, `practice_midterm.m`)
- Example/reference script (`example.m`)
- Published PDFs in `html/`

## Getting Started (MATLAB)

1. Open MATLAB in the repo root.
2. Start with `panel_flutter.m` (primary project-style script in this repo).
3. Use the `hw*.m` scripts for supporting course examples and derivation checks.
4. Compare results with the published PDFs in `html/`, especially `html/panel_flutter.pdf`.

## Suggested Showcase Files

- `panel_flutter.m`
- `hw7_redo.m` or `hw8*.m` (if they contain stronger analysis plots)
- `html/panel_flutter.pdf`
